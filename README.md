<!-- Guess-my-number -->
## :star2: About the Project
The project's aim is to guess a number that is randomly generated. It's one of my first projects, so I'll be happy to hear your opinion. The idea was taken from Udemy Course by Jonathan Schmedtmann🙏🏻Learn a lot from there💪🏻
##🛠️Functionality 
![You have a message that there is no number if so. Also there is the "Again" button, where you can restore everything. When you play, you see hints on the screen to help you win. Also you have a "Highscore" to follow your results. In the future planning to make a Leaderboard(or not)☀️] (https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1u0GGgGAze9Wq2ICuVRx3TItPYQg_slsi)
